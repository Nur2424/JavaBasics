===========================================
  üåü QUICK OOP CONCEPTS IN JAVA (BEGINNER)
===========================================

1. CLASS
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ –ø–ª–∞–Ω —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ–≤.
Example:
  class Book {
      String title;
      void read() { }
  }

2. OBJECT
- An object is an instance of a class.
- –û–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç ‚Äî —ç—Ç–æ —ç–∫–∑–µ–º–ø–ª—è—Ä –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∞.
Example:
  Book myBook = new Book();

3. ENCAPSULATION
- Hides internal data using private variables and public methods (getters/setters).
Example:
  private String title;
  public String getTitle() {
      return title;
  }

4. METHOD
- A method defines an action or behavior in a class.
Example:
  public void borrow() {
      isBorrowed = true;
  }

5. CONSTRUCTOR
- A special method called when creating a new object.
Example:
  public Book(String title) {
      this.title = title;
  }

6. INHERITANCE
- Allows one class to inherit features (fields and methods) from another.
Example:
  class Ebook extends Book {
      int fileSize;
  }

7. POLYMORPHISM
- The same method behaves differently depending on the object.
Example:
  class Book {
      void read() { System.out.println("Reading a book"); }
  }
  class Comic extends Book {
      void read() { System.out.println("Reading a comic"); }
  }

8. ABSTRACTION
- Hides unnecessary details; shows only essential parts.
Example:
  abstract class Shape {
      abstract void draw();
  }

9. ARRAYS AND COLLECTIONS
- You can store multiple objects in arrays or ArrayLists.
Example:
  Book[] books = new Book[5];

===========================================
You are already using many of these in your
Library & Book program!
